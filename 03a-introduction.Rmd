# Overview

__Modeling__

- Translate (bio)system to (set of) mathematical equation(s)
- __Model__: approximation of reality
    - Parameters!
- What is best approximation?

__Simulation__

- Experiment with model
    - Virtually (manual or computer)
- Calculations 
    - Analytical method
    - (Combination of) numerical method(s)

## Purpose of modeling

- Understand and analyse properties of system
- Predict behaviour of system under unknown circumstances
- __Find conditions for optimal performance__
    - E.g., least production cost, maximal output, ...
- Modify system to obtain desired behaviour (process control)

--> Use computer power

## Constituents of mathematical model

\begin{itemize}
\item Variables
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Inputs
    \item Outputs
    \item State variables: time and space coordinates
    \end{itemize}
\item Constants
\item \textbf{Parameters}: quantity whose value can change dependent on application
    \begin{exampleblock}{Examples}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item slope and intercept of linear model
    \item quantities that depend on environmental conditions of system such as temperature, pressure, ...
    \item decay rates
    \end{itemize}
    \end{exampleblock}
\end{itemize}

## Data types

- *Deterministic*
    - Exactly known, no uncertainty
    - Associated with 1 value
    - Simple calculations
- *Stochastic*
    - Associated with probability density function (PDF)
    - Uncertainty in data, described by PDF(s)
    - PDF: triangular, uniform, normal, ...
- *Fuzzy*
    - No exact knowledge on value
    - Membership functions
    - Can belong to multiple membership functions
    
## Model types

- *Deterministic*
    - Precise (exact) knowledge of all parameters, measurements, expected inputs and disturbances
    - No uncertainty in model behaviour
    - Makes analysis and simulation simple
    
    __Future behaviour model clear__
    
- *Stochastic*
    - Uncertainty about parameters, measurements, expected inputs or disturbances
    - At least some system parameters and variables stochastic
    - Uncertainty in prediction of model also described by PDFs
    
    __Future behaviour model in certain band/range__

## Model building

## Model building: Goal

- Determine **main purpose** of model *before* model building
- Important, partially responsible for model complexity
- Often forgotten or not clearly defined
    - Worthless models (too simple or too complex)
    - Loss of time and money
    
## Model building: Model selection

- Candidate models based on
    - Experimental data
    - Knowledge
    - Creativity
- **Choose** which model is **best suited** for goal
    - Goodness-of-fit
    - Model complexity
- If necessary model reduction
    - Variables: fast vs. slow
    - Equations
    - **Parameters**: eliminate those with least effect on system (smallest variation)

## Model building: Parameter estimation

Also called: model calibration

- Use experimental data to determine unique set of parameters that `_best fit_' the data
- Minimisation _objective function_
    - One-step
    - Iterative
        - Initial parameters: literature or data
        - Simulate model and evaluate objective function
        - Quantify difference between experimental output and simulated output
        - Refine parameters to reduce difference
        - Stopping criterion

## Model building: Validation

- Confront model with independent data set and for different conditions of input
- If OK, __validated__ model
- If not OK
    - Return to previous steps
    - Improve data or model

Iterative process until good validation obtained

## Part 2: Simulation of biosystems

Use model in combination with tools for system optimisation

1. Compare with experimental data
    - Model prediction close by experimental observations by choosing good parameters (_parameter estimation_)
2. Simulate model a number of times under different settings
    - Perturbation of a parameter (_local sensitivity_)
    - Deterministic vs stochastic (_global sensitivity_)
3. Different candidate models
    - Choose between candidates (_model selection_)
4. Combine all techniques
    - _Optimal experimental design_ for parameter estimation and/or model selection
