# Adulteration of olive oil

## Problem setting

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO):
\vspace*{0.5cm}

- High quality
- Flavorful
- Health benefits
- **More expensive** (than regular oil)

\vspace*{1cm}
To reduce cost, EVOO is often **adulterated** with other, cheaper food oils.

## Research questions

1. **Classification:** Can we detect whether a given EVOO sample has been adulterated?
    - Yes/no answer (categorical)
2. **Regression:** Can we detect the degree of adulteration?
    - Continuous answer, from 0% (no adulteration) to 100%

## Hyperspectral imaging (HSI)

![](./images/02b-pca-applications/hyperspectral.png){fig-align=center height=50%}

- Measures reflected infrared light (700-1800 nm) off sample
- Provides a non-destructive way of testing sample


## Hyperspectral "images" (spectra)

![](./images/02b-pca-applications/hsi-spectra.png){fig-align=center height=50%}

- HSI measures reflectance at 224 wavelengths from 700 to 1800 nm
- Reflectance at given wavelength is determined by molecular features of sample

## Experimental setup

Samples to test (61 total):

- 13 different kinds of unadulterated EVOO
- 6 vegetable oils
- 42 adulterated mixtures
  - EVOO + one of 6 vegetable oils at one of 7 different percentages (from 1% to 20%)

Each sample is imaged 3 times: **183 samples**

Each sample produces a HSI spectrum of **length 224**

## Data matrix

Data matrix has 183 rows (samples) and 224 columns (spectra).

In addition, we have some metadata:

  - Name of sample
  - Degree of adulteration

![](./images/02b-pca-applications/dataset.png)

## A first look at the data

Averaged spectra for each kind of oil (EVOO + 6 others)

![](./images/02b-pca-applications/spectra.png){fig-align=center height=60%}

Plot shows small differences between spectra: **promising sign** that we will be able to address the research questions.

## Principal component analysis: scree plot

Not all 224 wavelengths are equally informative. Much of our dataset is redundant.

![](./images/02b-pca-applications/scree-plot.png){fig-align=center height=50%}

This is confirmed by the scree plot: 

- First 2 PCs explain **94% of variance** in the data
- First 3 PCs: almost 100%

## Principal component analysis: loadings vectors

Loadings vectors are linear combinations of features, tell us how features contribute to variability in dataset.

![](./images/02b-pca-applications/first-two-pcs.png){fig-align=center height=50%}

For our example:

- Loadings vector 1: where do spectra differ the most?
- Loadings vector 2: where is next source of variability located?

## Principal component analysis: scores

![](./images/02b-pca-applications/oils-score-plot.png){fig-align=center height=60%}

Can we tell pure and adulterated samples apart?

- **Yes**: clearly different on score plot.

Can we predict the percentage of adulteration?

- **No**: hard to distinguish.
